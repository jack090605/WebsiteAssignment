                Matt James is one of many web developers we have at Hot Beans Web. 
                He is working on lots of projects at the moment for our multiple clients 
                and is currently leading two major projects for the company. Matt is a crucial part of the Hot Beans team 
                and without developers like Matt we wouldnâ€™t be able to produce outstanding content.</p>
